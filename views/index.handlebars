    <br>
    <h4> The timekeeper allows students to log their activies with a few inputs and a simple submit button. The user friendly interface allows students to track experiments and project progress, evaluate project resources, as well as
      provide key KPI metrics for faculty to quickly view porjects and report on. This tool can provide students and department heads the visibility of active projects and tasks completed in real time. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The <i><b>goal</b></i> of the timekeeper is to validate our project resources and provide feedback for successful level-loading of student activities in line with project goals and deliverables.
